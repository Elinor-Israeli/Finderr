### üöÄ Deploy on Render
**Render** is a cloud platform that simplifies deploying and managing applications. 

It supports web services, static sites, databases, and more, making it an excellent choice for hosting this **MERN** marketplace platform.

#### Step 1: Set Up MongoDB
To store application data, we need a MongoDB instance.

1. Create a MongoDB Instance:

Go to Render Databases and select "New Database".

Choose MongoDB, select a region, and create your database.

Copy the connection string (e.g., mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.mongodb.net/dbname).

2. Set Environment Variables for the Backend:
   
In your Render Web Service, add:

```
MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://your_user:your_password@your_cluster.mongodb.net/your_db
```

#### Step 2: Deploy Backend (Web Service)

The web service handles API requests and communicates with MongoDB.

1. Create a Web Service:

- Go to Render and click "New Web Service".
- Connect your GitHub repository containing the backend code.
- Choose Node.js as the environment.
- Set the build and start commands:

```
Build Command: npm install
Start Command: npm start

```
2. Add Environment Variables:

   In the Render dashboard, add the following variables:
```
MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://your_user:your_password@your_cluster.mongodb.net/your_db
PORT=5000
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloudinary_name
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_api_key
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_api_secret
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret

```
3. Save and Deploy the web service.

#### Step 3: Deploy Frontend (Static Site)
The frontend is a React Single Page Application (SPA) that will be deployed as a static site.

1. Create a Static Site:

Go to Render, click "New Static Site".
Connect your GitHub repository containing the frontend code.
Set the build and publish commands:

```
Build Command: npm install && npm run build
Publish Directory: dist (or build, depending on your setup)

```
2. Add Environment Variables:
In the Render dashboard, add:

```
VITE_API_URL=https://your-backend-service.onrender.com
```
Save and Deploy the static site.
