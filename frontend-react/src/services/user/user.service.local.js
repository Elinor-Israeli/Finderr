He asked to choose the premium package which means creation of a full LinkedIn profile from scratch. To be fair, I am going to list what are the things I have learned from him: how to put the symbol in the description, shared with me a list skills, that I have to put my full name in the first name, and how to customize my Linkedin URL. Finally, after I received the delivery, I asked if may he share with me a few versions of the “About” section. He said that he was not able to send more versions this is because I have to pay for it. Again, I have paid $50.",

Sometimes it was hard to get her to polish the details as I intended, I think because of the language barrier, but if a revision turned out different than I expected she started working on it again without asking questions. Lastly she gave tips about branding when needed. To be honest I'm not quite sure if the social media kit and website optimized image were worth my money, because those were mostly the same image in different ratios. But I probably had unrealistic expectations. On the other hand the copyright document is very polished and accurate!",

He created some concepts with literally no reference the first time around, and the second time around I gave him more of an idea of what I was looking for and found the ideal logo. You get what you pay for, and the price I think is a very good deal that's hard to find. Communication +asking questions is key to get all that you want and need from this great offer. Although I am satisfied with the logo, I probably would've liked something more like the work he shows in his second picture on his profile/gigs. I do recommend him!",

I submitted a revision proposal and hoped for the best. This is where this seller shines!

I know that a lot of his reviews say that he is amazing but I didn't expect nearly HALF of what I got. It was so good that I immediately printed it out and made it into my own little book to reference as I go through the process of building my Instagram audience. In all honesty, I think that he should charge way more for what he gives. I can't believe I got so much value at this very fair price! Thank you so much and I can't WAIT to implement your strategies starting TODAY!!",

Before we even proceeded he asked for my Instagram to make sure he could provided the services I requested. I was not prepared for the the whole breakdown!! I am shocked as to how much information I received for the price. Not only did i receive information regarding hashtags, but when to post, what to write under the post, how to not repost to the same things to become saturated . I can't wait to implement this new information to my Gram. Sooooo yeah about my unique niche go follow @ba_sayra.",

I did notice some spelling errors but that did not detract from the overall informative report. I am very pleased with the delivery and I learned A LOT. Also, the hashtags he provided were on point- very impressed. Let me preface this by saying that I had purchased similar hashtag research from another top seller on this platform and what I received was subpar. My business has elements of sustainability that I haven't pushed too much (because the 100% sustainable products haven't launched yet), but he picked up on it and delivered results that included this. 👏👏👏",
